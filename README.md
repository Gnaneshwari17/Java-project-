Effective task management is essential for productivity and organization. This project aims to develop a Task Management System that enables users to efficiently create, update, and delete tasks, set deadlines, and categorize tasks for better organization. The system will feature a user-friendly interface, allowing seamless task tracking and management.

The backend will be built using Spring Boot, ensuring robust and scalable API development, while MySQL will serve as the database for efficient data storage and retrieval. The front end will be developed using a modern framework such as React or Angular
By integrating these technologies, the Task Management System will offer a structured and efficient solution for individuals and teams to manage their workloads effectively.
